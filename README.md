## About the Project

This _Single Page Application_ (SPA) provides a solution for managing the Oompa Loompa workforce at Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. The application features two main views:

- **Workers List View** - Browse and filter through all Oompa Loompa workers
- **Worker Details View** - View detailed information about individual workers

The application supports filtering by `name` and `profession`, making it easy for HR personnel to find and manage specific workers or groups of workers.
